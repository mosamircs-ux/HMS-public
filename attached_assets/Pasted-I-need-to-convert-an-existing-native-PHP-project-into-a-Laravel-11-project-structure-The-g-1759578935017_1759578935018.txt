I need to convert an existing **native PHP project** into a **Laravel 11+ project structure**. The goal is to move the current logic and files into the appropriate Laravel directories while maintaining functionality and adopting Laravel's conventions where beneficial.

**Project Context:**
* **Current Project Type:** Native PHP (procedural or simple MVC structure).
* **Target Framework:** Laravel (preferably the latest stable version, e.g., 11).
* **Database:** [Specify your database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite].
* **Key Files/Directories (Example - **ADJUST THIS LIST** to match your project):**
    * `index.php` (main entry point)
    * `config/db.php` (database connection details)
    * `includes/` or `components/` (reusable functions, headers, footers)
    * `pages/` or `views/` (HTML/PHP files for output)
    * `functions.php` (global helper functions)
    * `models/` (if present, simple classes for data access)

---

### **Step-by-Step Conversion Plan:**

**1. Initial Setup and Environment:**
* **Setup:** Create a new Laravel project using `composer create-project laravel/laravel my-project`.
* **Configuration:** Move the database connection details from `config/db.php` (or similar) into the new Laravel project's `.env` file and `config/database.php`.

**2. Routing and Controller Mapping:**
* **Routing:** Analyze the routing logic from the native PHP project (e.g., how `$_GET` or URL segments were used to load different pages). Create corresponding **routes** in `routes/web.php` for each major page/URL.
* **Controllers:** Create a **Controller** in `app/Http/Controllers` for each group of related pages/functionality. For example, if you have `user_profile.php` and `user_settings.php`, map them to methods in a `UserController`.

**3. Views and Blade Templates:**
* **Views:** Move the content from the native PHP view files (e.g., files in `pages/` or `views/`) into **Blade template files** (`.blade.php`) in the `resources/views` directory.
* **Layouts:** Identify common elements (header, footer, navigation) and create a **main layout file** using Blade's `@include` and `@yield` directives to replace native PHP includes (`include 'header.php';`).

**4. Data Access and Models:**
* **Models:** Create **Eloquent Models** in `app/Models` corresponding to the main database tables.
* **Logic Migration:** Migrate the database query logic from the native PHP files into the new Controllers, utilizing **Eloquent ORM** for cleaner, object-oriented data interaction (e.g., replacing raw `mysqli_query` calls with `$user = User::find(1);`).

**5. Assets and Public Files:**
* **Assets:** Move all CSS, JavaScript, and image files into the Laravel project's **`public/`** directory.

**6. Helper Functions:**
* **Helpers:** Move essential custom functions from `functions.php` into a dedicated **helper file** (or a new class/trait) and ensure they are loaded and accessible within the Laravel environment.

**Expected Output:**
Please provide a **structured plan** with a list of the **required new files** (controllers, models, routes) and **code snippets** for the key transformations, such as an example of a simple native PHP page conversion into a Laravel route, controller method, and Blade view. Focus on the file organization and the basic conversion of one typical page as an example.
